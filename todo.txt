Questions to ask ?
1. what if a user after initializing a folder/workspace he shuts down PC 
   the folder is now in config file 
   now every time sender initalizes that folder msg'll be like already initalized 

2. why while init func in clone we're sending client public key instead of host public key
   i think because now host will've client's public key so when host will send
   requested data by encrypting it using client's public key to client , 
   client can decypt data using its public key 

Git-mini Functions :

   b. [done] store that file inside config folder 
   c. [done] store port address on which application is running
   d. [done] store recieved workspace folder also in user config file -> (new model added)

2. Security
   a . [] create another file to generate hash

3. Init
   a. [] for now workspace path & name is current directory but user should 
         also be able to host any other folder from PC
   b. [] also check that user entering workspace name & pass is already used or not ?
   c. [] on customize port user should be able to init workspace otherwise default port
